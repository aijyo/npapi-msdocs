== Make plugin screen look better ==
Replace nasty text message with dialog resource like this:

|Logo|
|Microsoft Office document is being opened.|
|Content-Type:|application/msword|
|File name:|test.docx|
|[Open online]|[Download and open]|
|[x] Remember the choice and do not ask me anymore|

== Develop an XPI Installer ==
Firefox installer to run on single click

== Ability to view documents in-place ==
Preview screen in browser window

== Use browser download and authentication ==
As of right now WinInet is used to download the file. It makes sense to use Firefox or Chrome to authenticate only once. This needs research though.
